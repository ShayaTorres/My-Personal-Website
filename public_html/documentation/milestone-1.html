        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p><strong>Name: </strong>Tara Cordon</p>
        <p><strong>Age: </strong>47</p>
        <p><strong>Profession: </strong>Engineering Manager of CyberLog.com, a cybersecurity website looking to hire a full-time Junior Full-Stack Engineer. They are a large remote-based work environment that employs 300+ people globally.</p>
        <p><strong>Technology: </strong>Uses a 2023 MacBook Pro and an iPhone 15.</p>
        <p><strong>Attitudes & Behaviors: </strong>Short on time, but interested in finding people with a combination of both technical skills and soft skills so she can create a well-rounded team. Tara spends 3-5 minutes looking at an applicant's portfolio site, and only about one minute on a resume. Tara typically seeks potential candidates through LinkedIn, which is the only social site she uses consistently.</p>
        <p><strong>Frustrations & Needs: </strong>Tara prefers to hire someone with 2-3 years of development experience who will start at a competitive entry-level salary. CyberLog is a leader in the cybersecurity industry and can offer full-benefits. Tara gets frustrated when she takes the time to view a candidate's site, but still doesn't get a feel for someone's personality and full skill-set.</p>
        <p><strong>Goals: </strong>Tara wants someone who will be a great fit for her team and will grow with the company.</p>
        <p><strong>User Story: </strong>As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a candidate for the entry-level Junior Full-Stack Engineer position.</p>
