/* MORE INFO NEEDED ---->
Purpose: The purpose of my personal website project is to create a site that will serve as my personal portfolio website with a focus on front-end web development.
Audience: My site will be viewed by industry professionals, recruiters, hiring managers, peers, and potential clients who want to learn more about my background and experience.
Goal: The primary purpose of this site is to serve as a web-based portfolio and to include contact information and a way to reach out to me via my contact form.
My goals for the site include acquiring full time employment and to attract freelance clients.
Another goal is to serve as a portfolio to promote my work, share previous work experience and the skills I've gained in various areas, and to track flow onto my website.


Persona
Name: Tara Cordon
Age: 34

Profession: Engineering Manager of CyberLog.com, a cybersecurity website that is looking to hire a full-time, remote Junior Full-Stack Engineer. They are a large remote-based work environment that employs 300+ employees.

*Technology: Mac user. Uses a 2023 MacBook Pro and an iPhone 15 with an unlimited 4G data connection.

Attitudes and Behaviors: Short on time and overworked, but interested in finding people who combine their technical skills and soft skills so she can create a well-rounded team. Tara spends 3-5 minutes looking at an applicant's portfolio site, and only about 1 minute on a resume. Tara typically seeks potential candidates through LinkedIn, which is the only social site she uses consistently.

Frustrations and Needs: Tara needs to hire someone with 2-3 years of development experience who is willing to start at a competitive entry-level salary, to start. CyberLog is a leader in the cybersecurity industry and can offer full-benefits.

Goals: Tara is only concerned with one thing: Is this person a potential candidate for the CyberLog Junior Full-Stack Developer position?

User Story: As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a candidate for the entry-level Junior Full-Stack Engineer position.

Thoughts to incorporate:
Someone who is short on time and needs to be impressed.
Someone who will be intrigued by my site and will want to learn more.
Person has one goal, and that is to weed out or include my website as a contender for the position.
Wants someone who is not only good with their skills, but who is a team player and enjoyable to be around - showcasing personality and talents.
Quickly determine eligibility, the company has long-standing trust with clients and tech community and are often a resource and an industry leader.
Wants someone who can work well with a team, but also a self starter who can manage and deliver their own projects up to standards.
The company has a mentorship program for jr devs, so they aren't looking for someone perfect, but someone who is teachable and good with feedback.

Build out three personas:
One for full time position
One for freelance clients
One for friends and family to better understand my skills and career

All three personas come from different angles and guide the functionality of the website and the needs that can be built in to the front-end.*/
