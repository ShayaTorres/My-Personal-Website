    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections.</p>
    <p><strong>Welcome/About Me:</strong><p> A brief one to two line introduction about me that will showcase my personality. This message will be overlaid on a background image of me - likely in front of a mural or landscape backdrop that will extend across the page. My vision is for the picture to be colorful and bold.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong><p>This section will include my core skills, including both technical and soft. This section is meant to be short and easily readable, but will also to speak to my experience, education, and knowledge. </p>
    <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong><p>This image gallery containing three examples of my work will serve as a representation of my abilities. The descriptions will include a short sentence about each example.</p>
    <p><strong>Contact:</strong><p>This section will contain a simple contact form. It will also include a footer where I will include my email address.</p>
